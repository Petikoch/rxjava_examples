* How to "split" one Observable in multiple
** the even numbers
** the odd numbers
* Based on the http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/groupby.html[groupBy] operator
* Everything runs synchronous in the same thread (main)

=== SplittingOddEvenAndAsyncHandlingExample

link:../src/main/java/ch/petikoch/examples/rxjava/splitting/SplittingOddEvenAndAsyncHandlingExample.java[]

* How to "split" one Observable in multiple
** the even numbers
** the odd numbers
* Handle each even number slowly, async in a separate thread
* Handle each odd number *very* slowly, async in a separate thread

Observations:

* The "even number handling thread" finishes earlier than the "odd number handling thread"
