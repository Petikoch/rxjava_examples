== Splitting Observables with RxJava and Java 8

=== SplittingOddEvenSyncExample

* How to "split" one Observable in multiple
** the even numbers
** the odd numbers
* Based on the http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/groupby.html[groupBy] operator
* Everything runs synchronous in the same thread (main)
* See also question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28854688/split-rx-observable-into-multiple-streams-and-process-individually

=== SplittingOddEvenAndAsyncHandlingExample

* How to "split" one Observable in multiple
** the even numbers
** the odd numbers
* Handle each even number async and slowly in a separate thread
* Handle each odd number async and *very* slowly in a separate thread

Observations:

* The "even number handling thread" finishes earlier than the "odd number handling thread"
