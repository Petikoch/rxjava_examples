== Backup requests pattern with RxJava and Java 8

=== WordCountWithBackupRequests

The backup requests pattern is a technique to deal e.g. with "long tail latencies".
See e.g. https://www.typesafe.com/blog/reactive-revealed-part-1-of-3-async-nio-back-pressure-and-the-message-driven-vs-event-driven-approach (slide 77 and
following) for an introduction.

How to implement this with RxJava?

* In an existing classic, synchronous codebase... sometimes a call is "slow"
* Solution: The relevant call (imagine calling a remote system) is wrapped with an rx.Observable and executed in a separate thread
* Using the http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/timer.html[timer] operator we setup a delayed backup call
* Using the http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/merge.html[merge] operator we merge the two calls
* And http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/first.html[first] emits the "faster" result and does the auto-unsubscribe resulting in cancelling the "slower" call

**Warning:**

* This is a simplified solution
* The problem is much more complicated in practice
** When is the timeout due? Hardcoded values don't fit well... You need something like e.g. a dynamically calculated 90th percentile
** What if the second call is also slow?
** What if the first call is answered just after the second call is issued? Would be nice to take that result and abort the second...
** What if __all__ calls are currently slow? You'll need something like a circuit breaker...
** You don't want retry-storms. What about an exponential backoff retry strategy like https://github.com/Netflix/ocelli/blob/master/ocelli-core/src/main/java/netflix/ocelli/retrys/ExponentialBackoff.java
** What if... (choose your own)
