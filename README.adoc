== Introduction

I'm not a RxJava expert. I'm a professional software engineer since 2001 who wants to figure out how to
do things "reactive" using RxJava and Java 8.

RxJava is very *very* powerful and it's not that easy to get "things right" as beginner, especially when you are doing
things asynchronously with multiple threads (Schedulers), backpressure, error handling, etc...

In this little Github project I collect and share some examples I made to better "understand things".

Thanks for your feedback and pointing to issues / potential improvements (just open a Github issue).

== Examples

Check out ./docs/01_index.adoc

== Warning

This is just example code. If you reuse it for productive usage, you'll likely have to extend it with unit tests, error handling, logging, ...

Best regards,
